          <div class="academic-time">2003 - 2017</div>
          <p>As you can see, I did my schooling entirely at Srivilliputtur. So, I was kind of known to a lot of people there. Academically, I am somewhere between first and middle bench students. I scored 96.6% in 10th standard and completed BioMaths with 87.3% in 12th standard. I participated in lot of extra curricular and cultural activities from my school istelf. Those includes the choir, and the inter-school competitions that I have participated. I have large circle of friends from school who are still in regular contact and I always cherish my School memories. </p>

          <h2>SASTRA</h2>
          <div class="academic-time">2017 - 2021</div>
          <p>My college life can be split into two phases: Before COVID and After COVID. Before COVID College life was the one where I had the most fun. I chose SASTRA whole-heartedly and I never regret about it. I opted Bio-Informatics and I did my Mini and Major projects on Data analysis and preparing a Manuscript on the same. I had great interest in music and cinema, So I participated in the events conducted by Tamil literary association(STS). Later, I became the organizer for the events I participated in. Because of that I got the chance to participate in the Inter college culturals at SSN, NIT Trichy and GCT. Almost all of my seniors and Friends were known through STS. Because of the COVID-19 breakdown, the batch of 2021 missed a whole 1 and a half years where we missed all our final year plans including Graduation ceremony and Farewell. Above all, We missed all the friendship moments eventhough we are connected Virtually.</p>

    <h1 class="interest">My Interests</h1>
    <h2 class="title">Cinema and Music</h2>
    <img class="left" width="300" height="300" src="images/cine.jpg" />
	<p>Music plays a major role in keeping myself free from stress and relaxes me more than anything else. It even motivates me during hectic days. There is no specific genre that I like, but listening to K-Pop boy band BTS's music helps me stay joyful and motivated. I have never learnt music professionally, but I like to toe-tap and groove along with the songs. Just like music, Cinema plays a major role in inspiring me and that makes who I'm today. Interests towards music and cinema made me participate in relatable events conducted by SASTRA Tamizh Sangam which plays a important part of my college life. Through that I got a lot of good people around me and It's very close to my heart which makes me cherish everytime I think.  </p>
    <h2 class="title">Arts and Crafts</h2>
	<img class="right" width="300" height="300" src="images/arts.jpg" >
    <p>Pencil sketching is something I got so interested about after seeing my friend doing it. I got some help from her about how she do it and tried it out myself. I tried my Brother's portrait and it came out well for a beginner. So, I continued sketching a lot more and gave it out those as gifts for some of them. My sketches has been included to the gallery section of last page. I have also did the Craft works like Explosion box, photo cube and other DIY and gave them out as gifts. I did craft work during the lockdown period out of boredom. It helped me to make crafts out of waste materials that were in house. I enjoy doing arts and crafts work while listening to some music.  </p>
    <h2 class="title">Drama and Webseries</h2>
	<img class="left" width="300" height="300" src="images/drama.jpg" />
    <p>Drama is something I started without knowing anything about it. Me and my friends started doing drama for a event conducted at my college. We started it from the scratch, right from story to executing a whole play on stage. We got so interested after doing our first play and did upto 4 dramas. Most of our stories were inspired from short stories. Crime-thriller, Time travel, Anthology and Psychic thriller were the genre we took as the main plot of the plays we did. After COVID-19 I was not able to continue doing plays on-stage but I still enjoy watching it. Apart from all other Hobbies, I'm interested in watching web series of any language. I mostly watch English, Korean and Tamil web series. I personally prefer Thriller and Sit-coms. I enjoy watching the TV series Friends and The vampire diaries a lot. I watch an episode daily as a relaxation.</p>
